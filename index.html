                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                  I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve
                  been looking to make a transition and have heard some people
                  who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free
                  intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                  thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling
                  - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve
                  successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer
                  at a VR startup.

                  Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of
                  code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help
                  me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
                  by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
                  things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did
                  not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
                  wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
                  particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next
                  level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've
                  often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                  developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
                  full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
                  recommend!

                Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp

                  The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I
                  find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence
                  necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself
                  as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.
                  You will get the personal attention you need from an
                  incredible community of smart and amazing people.
